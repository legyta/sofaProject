            We did not have friends. We could not go and see new beautiful
            countries, nor work on our career and try to become famous,
            well-known, someone who did truly important things for the humanity!

            "Please let me go..." I asked. "There are more sofas I can meet in
            my life. You are not the only one!!!" I kept telling her. But sofas
            can't talk. They just stand still as they are and thatâ€™s it.

            But love is love and I was not the stupid one, so I managed to come
            up with the best idea ever: If I can't go away from sofa, then sofa
            can go around the world with me. <br></br>

            So, sofa started traveling through the streets, venues, the best
            performing festivals around the world. Famous people do not need to
            travel themselves to visit me, as sofa and I arrive straight to
            them. Now they talk, they have fun, they can enjoy the cosiness of
            this legendary heavy, but flying all around the world piece of
            furniture. <br></br>

            On the 10th of March 2018, at the Performing Arts Forum (PAF,
            France) the first experiment to perform and share the work in
            progress with sofa-audience happened. Three of them came:<br></br>
