        This song is a collaboration between Marija, Mark and the doors of PAF
        (Performing Arts Forum). Marija always felt like sofa-type personality,
        whilst Mark found out he is a door type personality. Thus, they have
        decided to invite the doors of PAF to help with the Soundtrack for
        Sofas. It is never clear what objects are feeling or saying, or whether
        they have any consciousness at all. Because of this not-knowing, the
        music of doors is melancholic and sad.
