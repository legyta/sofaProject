                <li>I understand that this website is not for humans.</li>
                <li>
                  I confirm that I am entering this website for the benefit of
                  objects and furniture.

                <li>
                  Upon entering the website, I am recommended to act as little
                  human as possible and as much as I can as an object: staying
                  still, present, taking time, maybe putting a blanket on my
                  head if I feel like a couch and without too many human
                  thoughts or feelings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I understand that objects depend on me, so itâ€™s up to me to
                  decide if art made for non-human publics will reach my
                  objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I understand that this project is human friendly so I will do
                  my best to be object friendly too.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I will put a soundtrack created for objects for my objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I will invite or I will consider the possibility of inviting
                  Marija or other artists experienced in performances for
                  objects to come and perform for my things.
